    <p>A semi-spicy, delicious vegetarian yellow curry. Enjoy this with brown or white jasmine rice!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow curry paste</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped carrots</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup snow peas</li>
    </ul>
<ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Press tofu cubes between towels to drain excess water.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a shallow pan over medium heat. Cook tofu in the hot oil until golden brown and crispy on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and place on towels to soak up excess oil.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Open the can of coconut milk and scoop out the thicker top portion into a large wok or pan. Save the watery bottom portion. Cook over medium-high heat until bubbling and a thin layer of oil appears on the top, about 5 minutes. Add curry paste and stir to incorporate. Allow to cook, stirring so this mixture does not stick or burn, until the oil film reappears.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Add the rest of the coconut milk and enough vegetable broth to reach desired consistency; bring to a simmer. Stir in potatoes and simmer until almost tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in carrots, bell pepper, and snow peas; simmer until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add tofu and heat through, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve.</p>
